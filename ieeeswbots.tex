\section{The Emergence of Bots} 

% [Peggy]

% outline: the idea of turing test...
From the earliest days of computer programs, people have dreamed about programs that act, talk, and think like humans.
Such programs could not only automate tasks that humans perform, but they could also work with humans to solve intellectual tasks that cannot be entirely automated. 
Even as far back as 1966, the hope was for these programs to pass the Turing Test (proposed in the 1950 paper Computing Machinery and Intelligence \cite{Turing-1950}), where humans are fooled into believing they are interacting with an intelligent human rather than a mere program (reference Eliza Bot \cite{Weizenbaum:1966:ECP:365153.365168}). 

% outline: what is a chatbot or bot, and not about turing these days
The terms ``chatbot'', ``chatterbot'', and ``bot'' were interchangeably used to describe the realization of this vision quite early on, but nowadays they are mostly used to refer to a conversational-style user interface, an anthropomorphized script, or an agent that automates rote and tedious tasks.
Bots are not typically intended to fool end users into believing they are interacting with a real person, but many bots do have a pleasant and engaging personality. 
 
% outline:  where they reside and briefly what they do
Bots typically reside on platforms where users work or play with other users, and they frequently integrate other services into these channels, providing a conduit between users and other tools. 
They may fetch or share information, extract and analyze data, detect and monitor events and activities in communication and social media, connect users with each other or with other tools, or they may provide feedback and recommendations on individual and collaborative tasks. 

% outline: its time is now ... messaging platforms and also NLP
Bots are rapidly becoming a \emph{de facto} interface for interacting with software services. This is partly due to the widespread adoption of messaging platforms (e.g., Facebook\footnote{https://www.facebook.com/\label{Facebook}} for social networking and Slack\footref{Slack} for developer communication), and partly because of the advancement of natural language processing, which many bots leverage.
% outline: bring in AI and data
But another driver is the prevalence of ``big data'' along with machine learning algorithms for analyzing data across many domains.  Bots provide a convenient way for developers to generate a user interface for interacting with these algorithms and data. 

% outline: intuitive progression
% Developers use bots as well as create them. For developers, the transition from command line interfaces to interacting with bots through the messaging interface feels intuitive and has the advantage of bringing transparency of invoking and customizing services in a communication channel, while non-technical users are also embracing the notion of bots as opposed to installing and relying on apps that are not well integrated with their messaging environment. \cp{I'm not sure about this paragraph. Doesn't flow well in its current location and form, and I don't totally get the connection btwn the listed thoughts/concepts.} 

% what other companies are doing
Major software companies have started recognizing the value that bots bring in terms of integrating services, users, and communication channels. Facebook aims to ``replace apps'' one bot at a time in their messaging platform\footnote{http://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/11996896/Can-Facebook-Messenger-kill-off-apps.html}, while Microsoft claims that ``conversation as a platform'' is the operating system of the future\footnote{https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/Build/2016/C902}. 
Alexa\footnote{https://developer.amazon.com/alexa\label{Alexa}}, Siri\footnote{https://www.apple.com/ca/ios/siri/\label{Siri}}, IBM Watson, and Google Now
% \footnote{soon to be replaced by Google Assistant} 
are all platforms that support this rapid shift towards bots. 
There are also many bots in the platforms software developers frequently use to connect with other developers and services, such as Slack\footnote{https://slack.com/\label{Slack}}, Microsoft Teams\footnote{https://teams.microsoft.com/\label{Teams}}, and HipChat\footnote{https://www.hipchat.com/\label{Hipchat}}. 

% outline and main point in the rest of the column
%In this column, we first describe the key characteristics of bots and how they can be used to automate many end user tasks across a wide variety of user domains.  
%We next provide background for developers on how they can create and host bots on various platforms. These platforms support one or more software frameworks that developers can leverage to support the rapid creation and design of bots. We also discuss some design guidelines for bots, pulling ideas from the emerging area of human-robot interaction. 
%In a sidebar, we look at how developers themselves use bots in their development work.  We call out this domain because to quote XXX from StackOverflow, ``developers are writing the script for tomorrow'' and thus we see examples of sophisticated and innovative bots emerging from developer needs that pave the way for how bots may be created for other domains.
%Finally, we conclude this column with some considerations and advice for developers wishing to develop bots for their end users or wishing to use bots within their own development projects.   

% new attempt at segueway for rest of paper that is less academic sounding: (english needs some work)
% Developers use bots as well as create them.
For developers, transitioning from command line interfaces to interacting with bots through messaging interfaces feels intuitive.
Examples of sophisticated and innovative bots, emerging from developer needs, are paving the way for the design of bots in other domains. 
They are providing the inspiration for developing bots for end users, who are spending an increased amount of time in messaging applications and are openly embracing bots as an alternative to installing and relying on external apps.
Bot developers need to carefully consider where to host bots and how to create them, also when not to use bots. 
% \cp{I think there's a big hole between the previous paragraphs and this one...it doesn't flow. Why do we need to create and design bots for end users?}

\section{Botology: Understanding the Bot Landscape}
% [Peggy]


We have witnessed the development and widespread adoption of bots in just a few years, but what is truly surprising is the vast array of bots that support a magnitude of tasks and roles.  
Rather than attempting to narrowly define bots or chatbots, instead we embrace their diversity and look at ways of characterizing their distinct features.

One way to characterize bots is through the \textbf{interaction model} they provide. 
Some bots support a domain specific language where users interact with the bot using specific commands within a command line interface, while other bots may parse natural language through text or speech.  
These bots may also embed rich user interface controls in a platform to allow users to quickly respond to the bot.
% For example, the Felix bot\footnote{\url{http://felixbot.co/}} (which integrates in Slack) boosts personal productivity and a user interacts with Felix using commands such as ``start'' and ``done'' to tell Felix about the status of their personal tasks. \cl{Maybe this is a good place to introduce the other interaction models: embedded rich UI controls (buttons, menus, images, cards, lists, templates, etc.) to allow users to respond quickly to the bots, and speech.}
%Other bots rely tend to rely on natural language processing as well as speech, such as Apple's Siri. 

Bots also differ in terms of whether they support a pull-based approach, where users initiate the interaction with the bot (e.g., a user invokes the bot using commands such as ``Hey Siri''), or a push-based approach, where bots initiate the interaction based on some system or user context. 
%(e.g., the Poncho weather bot\footnote{\url{https://poncho.is/}} which can be used across several platforms including Facebook Messenger, Viber, Android and iPhone, will warn the user when it is about to rain). 
% does Poncho do that? I think it does...

Another way to characterize bots is in terms of their \textbf{intelligence}, which can be further distinguished as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Adaptation:} How ``context aware'' the bot is and how the bot may use that context to change how it interacts with users. 
% For example, ....
\item \emph{Reasoning:} Some bots follow simple logic rules,
% (e.g., IFTTT) 
whereas other bots use more advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI) to drive their behavior.
% how they automate tasks for users.  
% \cl{For example, Butter.ai\footnote{https://butter.ai/} connects and searches across multiple apps (e.g. Slack, Google Drive, Gmail, Dropbox, Evernote, Trello) to help users find the team document they are looking for without leaving Slack.}
\item \emph{Autonomy:}  Some bots may be entirely autonomous, whereas other bots rely on human input before taking action, while others may use a mixed approach.  
% For example, ....
\end{itemize}


Finally, bots can be characterized according to their \textbf{purpose}, as we summarize here: 
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Generalist} bots, such as Siri\footref{Siri} or M\footnote{https://m.facebook.com/}, support a wide range of simple tasks and  direct users to the appropriate external resources when deeper knowledge is required. 
\item \emph{Transactional} bots work on the user's behalf, executing transactions automatically with external systems (e.g., automatically making a purchase when a price level is reached).  
% \cl{Hipmunk bot (https://www.hipmunk.com/tailwind/hello-hipmunk-bot-for-skype/), Food Network Bot for recipes (https://www.messenger.com/t/FoodNetwork)}
\item \emph{Informational} bots fetch information for users (e.g., gathering insights about stocks or providing weather updates).  
% For example, the SwingTradeBot\footnote{\url{https://swingtradebot.com/}} helps its users stay on top of the stock market, by watching stocks and scanning the market for important developments and then alerting its users when they may need to take an action on their portfolio. \cl{Firebot, keeps it's users in the loop when they aren't able to watch the team's communication channels.  Firebot will notify users when channels are getting busy and can provide on-demand summaries of what they missed.}
\item \emph{Productivity} bots improve user or team productivity by automating rote or tedious tasks, such as updating calendars or silencing notifications.
 %  when you email the bot (see \url{x.ai}), or more sophisticated bots such as Tomatobot\footnote{\url{https://tomatobot.matthewhiggins.me/}} that integrates in Slack that help you follow the Pomodoro Method\footnote{\url{https://blog.trello.com/how-to-pomodoro-your-way-to-productivity}} for boosting one's productivity. \cl{tomatobot also silences other notifications}
\item \emph{Collaboration} bots help users communicate, coordinate, and collaborate (e.g., by connecting the right people at the right time).
% For example, the Meekan bot\footnote{\url{https://meekan.com/}} helps users coordinate and arrange their schedules to facilitate meetings.  Meekan integrates across a number of different platforms including Slack, Hipchat and Microsoft Teams. 
\end{itemize}

In the sidebar, we provide examples of how bots are used by developers to support their work. 
We call out this domain because of a quote from Joel Splosky of Stack Overflow\footnote{https://stackoverflow.com/\label{StackOverflow}}, where he claims ``developers are writing the script for tomorrow''. Everyday we see new examples of sophisticated and innovative bots to meet developer needs. These innovations pave the way for how bots may be used and created in other domains.
	
\section{Creating and Hosting Bots}

	\begin{figure*}[ht]
	  \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,height=400pt]{PlatformComparisonTable.pdf}
	  \caption{An overview of features for popular bot creation and distribution platforms. The final row of the table contains a collection of additional bot development technologies, sorted by category.}
	\end{figure*}

	Although simple bots can be built from scratch and self-hosted, many developers choose to leverage third-party frameworks to streamline the creation and distribution process. With the explosion of new tools in the bot development domain, we need to distinguish between the tools used to build bots (Creation Platforms) and the platforms where the bots dwell (Distribution Platforms).
	% why no footnote for Microsoft?
	Companies, such as Microsoft\footref{Microsoft} and Facebook\footref{Facebook}, offer comprehensive tooling to support both the creation and distribution of bots. Other companies provide customized resources for specific aspects of bot creation and distribution processes. 

	\subsection{Distribution Platforms}
	Distribution platforms are online ecosystems where bots reside and function. These platforms dictate where and how the bots are accessed by end users, and many center around messaging or social networking (e.g., Messenger, Skype, WeChat).  Other platforms are domain specific channels (e.g., Slack\footref{Slack}, Teams\footref{Teams}, and Hipchat\footref{Hipchat}) aimed at software developers.  
	% are there domain specific for other domains? 
	These platforms support human-bot, bot-bot, or even system-bot interactions.  

	Selecting the right distribution platform can lead to many benefits for developers.
	Some provide access to an existing user base\footnote{https://medium.com/mobile-lifestyle/messenger-vs-skype-vs-slack-vs-telegram-how-to-spot-the-winners-adc34b4ca066\label{How_to_spot_the_winners}}---
	launching a bot on an existing platform gives developers a head start in overcoming the cold-start user problem many new applications face. 
	% Selecting the wrong user base can be equally detrimental. 
	Developers should not only consider the size of the existing user base, but also the general user demographics as well as the costs for a user to access the platform.   
	Many distribution platforms define and standardize how users can interact with bots, and such platforms have built-in support for commands, natural language, speech, and even rich UI controls.  The method of interacting with a bot strongly influences the user's experience as well as the types of tasks that can be preformed.
	
	Many distribution platforms offer discovery mechanisms\footref{How_to_spot_the_winners} with different ways for users to discover and try out new bots. Similar to Apple's App-Store\footnote{http://www.apple.com/ca/ios/app-store/}, some platforms offer virtual ``bot stores'' where users browse for bots. Third-party sites (e.g., BotList\footnote{https://botlist.co/}, Chatbottle\footnote{https://chatbottle.co/}) also provide online catalogs of bots for many popular distribution platforms, which make it easier for developers to promote and market their bots. 
	Mature distribution channels also have monetization features\footref{How_to_spot_the_winners} with mechanisms that allow bots to safely collect payments from users, a particularly useful feature when developing transactional-style bots.

	A summary of popular distribution platforms and their associated technologies is included in Figure 1.  This is not a comprehensive list of all possible platforms, but rather a sample of popular technologies that bot builders can leverage.

	\subsection{Creation Platforms}

	Creation platforms support the design and development of bots, and provide a variety of software foundations, frameworks, toolkits, APIs, and other advanced features (e.g., natural language processing, search, image processing). Bot creation platforms themselves may be distribution platform specific or produce bots that can be deployed across multiple distribution platforms, such as the Microsoft Bot Framework\footnote{https://dev.botframework.com/}, BotKit\footnote{https://www.botkit.ai/}, and PandoraBots\footnote{https://www.pandorabots.com/}.
	
	The services these creation platforms provide range from documentation and code templates, to no-code-required bot building interfaces such as ChatFuel\footnote{https://chatfuel.com/}. 
	Many of the popular bot creation platforms also belong to vibrant developer ecosystems---developers can connect with these online communities to obtain developer expertise in the form of tutorials, articles, discussions, and support.  Other general bot development communities, such as the BotMaker's Slack group\footnote{https://botmakers.org/} and the Chatbot New Community\footnote{http://news.chatbotsmagazine.com/}, are a hotbed for discussions on a variety of bot-related topics.

	A summary of popular creation platforms and services are provided in Figure 1.

 \section{Thoughts on Bots}
	
% [Peggy]

	Bots are rapidly becoming pervasive: we interact with them in cars, at home, in entertainment devices, and at work, and as we discussed in the sidebar, bots play a sophisticated and increasingly significant role in software development projects.  
	We need to learn from these early adoption experiences to find out what works well, but also what may go wrong.  We conclude this column with some advice we have gleaned about how to best use bots (or not).   
	But we encourage developers to form their own opinions as they observe and interact with bots. 
	\cp{I think this intro paragraph needs more meat, and the last sentence should be cut or further explained to make it useful to the discussion.} 
	
	
	\subsection{To Bot or Not: Amplification Doesn't Replace Collaboration}
		Bots are frequently used in group or collaborative settings as 
		it has become easy to automate many of the tasks that would normally require human interaction. But removing collaboration opportunities can have detrimental effects on creativity and productivity. 
		Rather than replacing collaboration, bots can be used to reduce friction in communication or task coordination. For example, bots may provide transparency on task progress, make team goals more visible, link experts with novices, as well as build team trust and cooperation \cite{lebeuf2017software}.
		However, the poor design or overuse of bots may lead to information and interruption overload---something bot designers need to be aware of and to watch out for.  

	\subsection{Bot or Human? The User Should Always Know What to Expect}

	Unlike the Turing bots proposed back in the 1950s, bot developers should make it clear to users that they are interacting with a bot rather than speaking with another human. 
	Similarly, if a bot passes control to a human (e.g., when the bot cannot understand a command or answer a question), the user should be aware of this and the handover should be handled gracefully and transparently. This insures users do not lose trust with the system supported by the bots and that they understand why control is being passed to a human. 
	It is also important that the purpose of the bot---what it can and can't do---be evident and match the user's expectations. 
	%Another issue arises when bots try to be everything to everyone at once; it's better to do one thing well than many things poorly. Since the bot paradigm is still relatively novel, many users are willing to overlook some shortcomings.  To minimize disappointment and user frustration, Facebook's bot best practices recommends clearly defining expectations with the bot's users. This includes how often the bot will be responding, what core functionality it supports, and when it is unable to complete a request.  When a bot does not understand, it should reiterate it's capabilities or direct users to it's help functionality.


	\subsection{Bot Talk: How to Talk to and Be Heard by Bots}
	% Control the conversational flow}

	Ideally, users' interactions with bots should be smooth and frictionless. 
	This can be achieved if designers carefully plan potential conversational flows, especially for conversational bots. For example, bots ma need to repeat a user's commands so the user knows the bot is listening, and bots need to be able to detect dead ends in a conversation and prompt the user by giving hints on how to continue the interaction. Some bots may incorporate UI elements to reduce the number of user clicks required and to make the conversation more efficient. 
	Implementing global input checks for common navigational keywords (help, back, cancel, start over, exit) can help avoid the creation of ``stubborn'' or ``clueless'' bots\footnote{https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/bot-design-principles}.
	While tools like BotMock\footnote{https://botmock.com/} can be used prototype the user's ``journey through your bot''. 
%
%They should be guided through their interactions, through carefully planned out conversational flows. Avoiding using stand alone questions or dead end statements, and instead provide hints into the bots functionality with syntax hints and UI elements (buttons, menus, lists) where appropriate. 
%	A bot is more likely to be successful if it solves a user's ``problem better/easier/faster than any of the alternative experiences''\footnote{https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/bot-design-principles}.  Clever use of rich UI elements, such as buttons and quick-replies, greatly reduce the number of clicks required per task.  Commands provide accelerators for speeding up an expert or mission driven user's navigation.
%
	Finally, many platforms have specific guidelines one can follow, e.g., Facebook recommends their bots follow a set of simple conversational guidelines\footnote{https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/introduction/design-best-practices}. 
	%Bots should use they active voice, in first or second person as appropriate.  Punctuation also plays a large role in the way the bot is perceived, so it can be leveraged to convey emotion but not at the expense of good grammar.  Lastly, proper spelling, capitalization, and sentence structure ensure that the meaning behind the message is not lost.


	\subsection{Personality Matters More Than Looks} 
	As bots are predominantly text based, how a bot uses language---even how it is named---influences users' perception of its personality, role, and capability.  This may seem surprising given that users should know they are interacting with a mere program, but early research has shown that a bot personality changes how users interact with them. 
	% A bot's choice of language helps define and build its personality.  
	Even if a bot can effectively accomplish a user's tasks, people won't adopt the bot if they find the bot boring. The choice of language should be casual, accessible, friendly, and fun.  Bots should expect users to test their abilities and respond accordingly.
	%like conversations in general, are more casual than many other company-user communication channels (e.g. websites, emails).  Bot's should aim to use friendly, accessible language and repeat inputs back to the user to they know it's listening. But developers should also feel free to have a bit of fun with users trying to test the bot (e.g. entering random inputs or repeating the same question). 
	But too much personality may not be a good thing either.  According to Slack\footnote{https://api.slack.com/best-practices/}, ``a little goes a long way''.  Done right, bots can accentuate a company's brand and enhance culture.
	% We cannot say this enough.'' 
	% A bot's personality should accentuate their company's brand or fit seamlessly into their team's culture.  

\subsection{Bots Should Do No Harm}

% 	Another challenge they may introduce includes privacy intrusion. 

	Bots, like robots, should do no harm to users.  
	Asimov's laws for robots~\cite{asimov1950evitable} state that 
	robots shall not harm humans, robots will obey orders, and robots will protect themselves, which can also apply to software bots.
	But perhaps these rules are too simple with the complexity and rapid growth of bots in our software ecosystems.  Simple mistakes could have devastating effects, and a user's privacy may be hard to protect.  
	We can expect to see a code of ethics for human-bot interactions in the near future\footnote{https://www.partnershiponai.org/} \footnote{https://www.knightfoundation.org/press/releases/knight-foundation-omidyar-network-and-linkedin-founder-reid-hoffman-create-27-million-fund-to-research-artificial-intelligence-for-the-public-interest}, but in the meantime, developers should carefully consider how their bots may be misused, either intentionally or unintentionally. Many bots are already seen as malicious, thus building trust with users may also pose a challenge. 
	For now, many of the platforms that support the creation and distribution of bots also provide developers with basic principles or best practices for bot design (Microsoft\footnote{https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/}, Facebook\footnote{https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/design-resources}, Slack\footnote{https://api.slack.com/best-practices/}).
	But developers wishing to use or create bots for their end users need to be careful which bots they bring to life.
	

\section*{Sidebar}

Software developers are early adopters and proponents of bots as they recognize their potential to enhance individual and team productivity as well as significantly improve software quality. For developers, the transition from command line interfaces to interacting with chatbots feels intuitive and has the advantage of bringing awareness and transparency within the communication channel, while non-technical team members gain the option to engage with the operations (e.g., using a bot to deploy).

SendWithUs, a company that provides transactional email services, has described to us how they've adopted bots as part of their software development process. With 15 employs and two office locations (Victoria and San Fransisco), the company uses Slack as the central hub of their communication and Dev-Ops, and bots fulfill a number of specific development tasks. For example, their bots provide support by:

\begin{itemize} 
\item Setting reminders to themselves or other team members [Slackbot]
\item Managing and coordinating costumer support and helpdesk tickets [Help Scout](https://www.helpscout.net)
\item Facilitating real-time communication with users visiting their website [Olark piped into Help Scout](https://www.olark.com/)
\item Connecting and managing physical communication (e.g., SMS and Phone) to the company's communication hub---Slack [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/)
\item Accommodating custom tasks (e.g., ordering a team's lunch via a message on Slack) [Hubot](https://hubot.github.com/)
\item Automatically sharing resources and documents within the team (e.g., screenshots) [Dropbox \& Google drive]
\item Managing and tracking code migrations and deployments from within Slack, and raising team awareness when this happens (as this may cause errors during migration) [Custum bot with the Heroku integration]
\item Monitoring and indexing runtime warnings, errors, and exceptions [Papertrail](https://papertrailapp.com/)
\item Notifying the appropriate team members on errors and exceptions [Sentry](https://sentry.io/welcome/)
\item Tracking and aggregating service-status of other service providers that the company depends on [statuspage.io]
\end{itemize}

Developers can expect to see more and more bots being introduced to support their workflow and development related activities. However, companies like SendWithUs also recognize their dependability on Slack and the many tasks done by bots, that have become crucial to the running of the company.

% why bots in SE

%Software developers are early adopters and proponents of bots as they recognize their potential to enhance individual and team productivity as well as significantly improve software quality \cite{storey2016disrupting}. 
% why so much adoption in SE; and some not really bots
%The adoption of bots in software development has been eased along by the fact that developers engage in communication and source code repository hubs, such as Slack\footref{Slack}, Microsoft Teams\footref{Teams}, Atlassian's Hipchat\footref{Hipchat} and GitHub\footnote{http://github.com}. These tools provide a number of integrations with other services, with many of these integrations being referred to as bots (although some are more like a scripting language interface than a chatbot). \cl{this bit is a tad repetitive. Maybe we could mention the benefits like team visibility, ease of access for ``non-technical'' team members, etc?}
%Furthermore, developers feel very much at ease using the bot frameworks that are available in these platforms to create bots to address friction points they experience in their own development projects. \cp{they do? why/how?}
 
%We see bots fulfilling a number of specific development tasks. For example, bots provide support to developers by:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item 
% automatically committing code after testing (Jenkins CI\footnote{https://plugins.jenkins.io/}); 
% automatically creating bugs when tests fail (BugBot\footnote{https://smallwins.today/bugbot}); 
% automatically merging pull requests after code reviews (Travis\footnote{https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/notifications/}); 
% automatically opening issues when code quality concerns are detected (Freud\footnote{https://www.slideshare.net/svenpeters/rise-of-the-machines-automate-your-development-54456075/56-Freud\_Botfor\_Pull\_Requests\label{Atlassian}});
% automatically testing for user interface changes when code changes are submitted (CompareBot\footref{Atlassian}); 
% helping teams manage complex builds and supporting deployment from within the chat environment (as Hubot\footnote{https://hubot.github.com/} does); 
% centralizing service and performance monitoring (PagerDuty\footnote{https://www.pagerduty.com/integrations/}); and
% interacting with end users (at scale) to answer frequently asked questions and to analyze their feedback (ZenDesk's AnswerBot\footnote{https://www.zendesk.com/answer-bot/}).
%\end{itemize}

% Bots are also making their way into the developer's IDE. For example, Slack-Overflow\footref{StackOverflow} is a new bot that integrates Stack Overflow into Visual Studio.  This bot leverages Microsoft's AI platform to help find the best information from Stack Overflow to meet developer needs based on their development context. 
% Developers can expect to see more and more bots being introduced into the tools and platforms they use for development related activities.  \cl{we have seen similar integrations (code reviews, github, etc) in IDEs, its interesting that they are now taking a ``bot'' or ``chat'' style roll} \cp{I think this final paragraph needs more meat...it feels like the paper is missing a proper conclusion...some zinger that sticks in peoples' minds.}
