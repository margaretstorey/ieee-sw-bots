\section{The Emergence of Bots} 

% [Peggy]

% outline: the idea of turing test...
From the earliest days of computer programs, developers have imagined the emergence of programs that can act, talk and think like humans.
Such programs would not only automate tasks that humans might do, but they could also work with humans to solve intellectual tasks that cannot be entirely automated. 
The hope, even as far back as 1966, was for these programs to pass the Turing Test (proposed in the 1950 paper Computing Machinery and Intelligence [s]), where humans could be fooled into believing that they are interacting with an intelligent human rather than a mere program (reference Eliza Bot [x]). 

% outline: what is a chatbot or bot, and not about turing these days
The terms ``chatbot'' and ``bot'' were interchangeably used to describe the realization of this vision quite early on, but today they are used to refer to a conversational style user interface or an anthropomorphized script or agent that can automate rote and tedious tasks.
Bots are not (typically) intended to fool the end user into believing a bot is a real person, but many bots do have a personality that is engaging and pleasant to interact with. 
 
% outline:  where they reside and briefly what they do
Bots typically reside on popular platforms where users work or play with other users, and frequently integrate other services and micro-services into these channels, providing a conduit between users and other software services. 
They may fetch or share information, extract and analyze data, detect and monitor events and activities in communication and social media, connect users with each other or with other tools, or they may provide feedback and recommendations on individual and collaborative tasks. 

% outline: its time is now ... messaging platforms and also NLP
Bots are rapidly becoming a \emph{defacto} interface for interacting with software services in just the past few years.  In part, this is because of the widespread adoption of messaging platforms (e.g., Facebook for social networking and Slack for developer communication) and in part because of the advancement of natural language processing, which many bots (but not all) leverage.
% outline: bring in AI and data
But another driver is the prevalence of ``big data'' along with machine learning algorithms for analyzing data across many domains.  Bots provide a convenient way for developers to generate a user interface for interacting with these algorithms and data. 

% outline: intuitive progression
Developers use bots as well as create them. For developers, the transition from command line interfaces to interacting with bots through the messaging interface feels intuitive and has the advantage of bringing transparency of invoking and customizing services in a communication channel, while non-technical users are also embracing the notion of bots as opposed to installing and relying on apps that are not well integrated with their messaging environment.  

% what other companies are doing
\cl{Major software companies are clearly recognizing...}
All of the major software software companies clearly recognize the value that bots bring in terms of integration of services, users and communication channels. Facebook aims to ``replace apps'' one bot at a time in their messaging platform [x], while Microsoft claims that ``conversation as a platform'' is the operating system of the future rather than Windows [x]. 
Amazon's Alexa, Apple's Siri and Google's Now \cl{soon to be replaced by Google Assistant} platform are also showing agreement with this rapid shift towards bots. \cl{IBM Watson?}
Software developers will also recognize many bots in the platforms they frequently use to connect with other developers and services, such as Slack [x], Teams [x] and HipChat [x]. 

% outline and main point in the rest of the column
In this column, we first describe the key characteristics of bots and how they can be used to automate many end user tasks across a wide variety of user domains.  
We next provide background for developers on how they can create and host bots on various platforms. These platforms support one or more software frameworks that developers can leverage to support the rapid creation and design of bots. We also discuss some design guidelines for bots, pulling ideas from the emerging area of human-robot interaction. 
In a sidebar, we look at how developers themselves use bots in their development work.  We call out this domain because to quote XXX from StackOverflow, ``developers are writing the script for tomorrow'' and thus we see examples of sophisticated and innovative bots emerging from developer needs that pave the way for how bots may be created for other domains.
Finally, we conclude this column with some considerations and advice for developers wishing to develop bots for their end users or wishing to use bots within their own development projects.   

  

\section{Botology: Understanding the landscape of bots}
\cl{Bot-ology?}
% [Peggy]

\todo{improve and add more examples}


It has been surprising to see the rapid development and widespread adoption of bots in just a few years, but what is more surprising is the vast array of bots that support so many diverse tasks and roles.  
Rather than attempting to narrowly define bots or chatbots, instead we look at how they may be characterized. 

One way to characterize bots is through the \textbf{interaction model} they provide. 
Some bots support a domain specific language where the user interacts with the bot using specific commands within a command line interface.  For example, the Felix bot\footnote{\url{http://felixbot.co/}} (which integrates in Slack) boosts personal productivity and a user interacts with Felix using commands such as ``start'' and ``done'' to tell Felix about the status of their personal tasks. \cl{Maybe this is a good place to introduce the other interaction models: embedded rich UI controls (buttons, menus, images, cards, lists, templates, etc.) to allow users to respond quickly to the bots, and speech.}
Other bots rely tend to rely on natural language processing, such as Apple's Siri. \cl{Siri understands natural language + speech, }

Bots also differ in terms of whether they support a pull based approach, where the user initiates the interaction (e.g., a user invokes the bot using commands using ``Hey Siri''), or the bot may initiate the interaction based on some system or user context (e.g., the Poncho weather bot\footnote{\url{https://poncho.is/}} which can be used across several platforms including Facebook Messenger, Viber, Android and iPhone, will warn the user when it is about to rain). 
% does Poncho do that? I think it does...

Another way to characterize bots is in terms of their \textbf{intelligence} which we further can characterize as follows:
\todo{Carly to expand on these bullets}
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{Adaptation:} How ``context aware'' the bot is and how the bot uses that context to change how it interacts with the user(s).  For example, ....
\item \emph{Reasoning:} Some bots follow very simple logic rules (e.g., IFTTT) whereas others bots use more advanced Artificial Intelligence (AI).  \cl{For example, Butter.ai\footnote{https://butter.ai/} connects and searches across multiple apps (e.g. Slack, Google Drive, Gmail, Dropbox, Evernote, Trello) to help users find the team document they are looking for without leaving Slack.}
\item \emph{Autonomy:}  Some bots may be entirely autonomous whereas other bots rely on a human user's input.  For example, ....
\end{itemize}



Finally, bots may be characterized according to their \textbf{purpose}, as we summarize here: 
\cl{maybe we could also distinguish between generalist bots (like Siri or M) vs specialist bots (like the ones below)?}
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{transactional} bots work on behalf of the users, providing support for transactions with external systems.  \cl{Hipmunk bot (https://www.hipmunk.com/tailwind/hello-hipmunk-bot-for-skype/), Food Network Bot for recipes (https://www.messenger.com/t/FoodNetwork)}
\item \emph{informational} bots exist to provide critical information to its users.  For example, the SwingTradeBot\footnote{\url{https://swingtradebot.com/}} helps its users stay on top of the stock market, by watching stocks and scanning the market for important developments and then alerting its users when they may need to take an action on their portfolio. \cl{Firebot, keeps it's users in the loop when they aren't able to watch the team's communication channels.  Firebot will notify users when channels are getting busy and can provide on-demand summaries of what they missed.}
\item \emph{productivity} bots aim to improve a user's or team's productivity by automating rote or tedious tasks such as updating a calendar automatically when you email the bot (see \url{x.ai}), or more sophisticated bots such as Tomatobot\footnote{\url{https://tomatobot.matthewhiggins.me/}} that integrates in Slack that help you follow the Pomodoro Method\footnote{\url{https://blog.trello.com/how-to-pomodoro-your-way-to-productivity}} for boosting one's productivity. \cl{tomatobot also silences other notifications}
\item \emph{collaboration} bots support how users communicate, coordinate or collaborate their tasks.  For example, the Meekan bot\footnote{\url{https://meekan.com/}} helps users coordinate and arrange their schedules to facilitate meetings.  Meekan integrates across a number of different platforms including Slack, Hipchat and Microsoft Teams.
% I have too many software development examples? 
\end{itemize}
	
	
\section{How to create Bots and where to host them}

	Although simple bots can be built from scratch and self-hosted, many developers choose to leverage third-party frameworks to streamline the process. With the explosion of new tools in the bot development domain, if is important to distinguish between the tools used to build bots (Creation Platforms) and the platforms where they dwell (Distribution Platforms).

	Many large companies, such as Microsoft and Facebook for example, offer a comprehensive set of tools to support both the creation and distribution of bots. Other companies, provide specialized solutions for specific aspects of bot creation and distribution. 

	\subsection{Distribution Platforms}
	The distribution platforms are the online ecosystems where the bots reside. They define where and how the bots are accessed by users. Although typically messaging platforms, bot distribution platforms range from general purpose social networks (e.g. Facebook Messenger, Skype, WeChat) to domain specific channels (e.g. Slack, Teams, and Hipchat aimed towards software developers).  These platforms can support human(s)-bot, bot-bot, or even system-bot interactions.  

	Selecting the right distribution platforms offer many benefits for developers: access to an existing user base\footnote{https://medium.com/mobile-lifestyle/messenger-vs-skype-vs-slack-vs-telegram-how-to-spot-the-winners-adc34b4ca066\label{How_to_spot_the_winners}}, defined interaction models, discovery\footref{How_to_spot_the_winners}, and monetization\footref{How_to_spot_the_winners}.  

	Launching a bot on an existing platform gives developers a head start in overcoming the cold-start user problem that many new applications face. Selecting the wrong user base, however, can be equally detrimental. Developers should not only consider the size of the existing user base, but also the general user demographics as well as the costs for a user to access the platform. 

	Distribution platforms also offer the benefit of defining and standardizing how users can interaction with bots.  Many platforms come with built in support for commands, natural language, speech, and even rich UI controls.  The method of interacting with the bots, strongly influences the users experience of using the bot.

	Many distribution platforms also offer ways for users to discover and try out new bots. Similar to Apple's App-Store [x], many distribution platforms offer virtual ``bot stores'' where users browse for bots. Third-party sites (e.g. BotList) also offer online catalogs of bots for many popular distribution platforms. These ``bot stores'' and catalogs are an easy way for bot developers to promote and market their bots. Mature distribution channels often also offer means for the bots to safely collect payments from users, which can be particularly usefully when developing transactional style bots.

	A summary of popular distribution platforms and technologies is included in figure X.  It should be noted that this is not a comprehensive list of all possible platforms, but rather a sample of popular technologies.

	\subsection{Creation Platforms}

	The creation platforms support the design and development of bots. They provide a variety of software foundations (e.g. frameworks, tool kits, APIs) as well as other goodies such as natural language processing, search, image processing, etc. These bot creation services can be platform specific (e.g. Slack, Facebook) or produce bots that can be deployed across multiple distribution platforms (e.g. Microsoft Bot Connector, BotKit, PandoraBots). The services they provide range from documentation and code templates, to no-code-required bot building interfaces (e.g. ChatFuel, ). 
	Many of the popular bot creation platforms also offer vibrant developer ecosystems. Developers can plug into these online communities for developer expertise in the form of tutorials, articles, discussions, and support.  Other general bot development communities, such as the BotMaker's Slack group\footnote{https://botmakers.org/} and the Chatbot New Community\footnote{http://news.chatbotsmagazine.com/}, are a hotbed for discussions on a variety of bot-related topics.

	A summary of popular creation platforms and technologies is included in figure X.

	\subsection{Design guidelines}

	Many of the platforms not only support the creation and distribution of bots, but also provide developers with basic principles or best practices for bot design (Microsoft\footnote{https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/}, Facebook\footnote{https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/design-resources}, Slack\footnote{https://api.slack.com/best-practices/}).

	We highlight three important design considerations for bots.

	\subsubsection{Don't pretend}

	Unlike traditional Turing bots, developers should make it clear to the user that they are not speaking with another human. This helps avoid the \emph{icky} feeling of distrust when the user inevitably figures out they are actually chatting with a bot.

	Pretending isn't simply restricted to bots attempting to disguise themselves as humans. Some bots allow for human intervention when a user has a question or task that the bot is unable to provide an appropriate response to.  This switch must be handled gracefully and transparently, as it can lead to similar user distrust if they suddenly realize they're not chatting with a bot anymore.

	Another issue arises when bots try to be everything to everyone at once; it's better to do one thing well than many things poorly. Since the bot paradigm is still relatively novel, many users are willing to overlook some shortcomings.  To minimize disappointment and user frustration, \textit{Facebook's bot best practices}[x] recommends clearly defining expectations with the bot's users. This includes how often the bot will be responding, what core functionality it supports, and when it is unable to complete a request.  When a bot does not understand, it should reiterate it's capabilities or direct users to it's help functionality.


	\subsubsection{Control the conversational flow}

	A user's interaction with a bot should be smooth and frictionless. They should be guided through their interactions, through carefully planned out conversational flows. Avoiding using stand alone questions or dead end statements, and instead provide hints into the bots functionality with syntax hints and UI elements (buttons, menus, lists) where appropriate. Tools like BotMock\footnote{https://botmock.com/} can be used prototype the user's ``journey through your bot''.

	A bot is more likely to be successful if it solves a user's ``problem better/easier/faster than any of the alternative experiences''\footnote{https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/bot-design-principles}.  Clever use of rich UI elements, such as buttons and quick-replies, greatly reduce the number of clicks required per task.  Commands provide accelerators for speeding up an expert or mission driven user's navigation.
	Implementing global input checks for common navigational keywords (help, back, cancel, start over, exit) can help avoid the creation of ``stubborn'' or ``clueless'' bots\footnote{https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/bot-design-principles}. 

	\subsubsection{Tone builds personality}

	The language a bot uses helps define and build its personality.  Conversations with bots are generally considered to be more casual than other company-user communication channels (e.g. websites, emails). But don't go too heavy on the personality, according to Slack, ``A little goes a long way. We cannot say this enough.''\footnote{https://api.slack.com/best-practices/}. A bot's personality should accentuate their company's brand or fit seamlessly into their team's culture.

	Facebook's guidelines recommend using the active voice, in first or second person\footnote{https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/introduction/design-best-practices}.  Punctuation also plays a large role in the way the bot is perceived, so it can be leveraged to convey emotion but not at the expense of good grammar.  Proper spelling, capitalization, and sentence structure ensure that the meaning behind the message is not lost.

\section{Takeaways}

	[Peggy]
	These days, bots are becoming pervasive.  End users experience them in cars, in the home, in entertainment devices and at work.  We see them particularly playing a significant and sophisticated role in many software development projects (as we discussed in the side bar).  
	We suggest that developers learn from these experiences and watch for innovative ways to deploy them in their own projects (to improve their own activities but also as a feature for their end users), but at the same time, not to overuse them! 
	We suggest that careful attention should be paid to the challenges they may introduce including information overload and interruptions.  
	
	
	[Carly]

	We can't hide behind our bots, in the growing age of human-machine interactions.  With the ease of automating our everyday tasks, it is easy to begin to automating away many of the tasks that would normally require human interaction. Removing collaboration can have detrimental effects on creativity and productivity. Developers can use ``automation to amplify social communication and cognition''.

	Instead of automating collaborative processes, developers should instead focus designing bots to reduce friction or blockers that can occur when collaborating. Bots can help connect developers with experts. They can remind developers of and help them adhere to team procedures and agreements. They can provide visibility into the progress begin made and provide updates on team goals. They can also aid in coordinating team activities. They can even promote team trust and cooperation. Developers should choose Bots, not to remove collaboration, but use them to enhance collaboration. (reference CSCW workshop paper)

	\cl{We can use the bots in group settings rather than one-on-one.}

	[Carly]
	Another challenge they may introduce includes privacy intrusion. 

	Robots shall not harm humans. Robots will obey orders. Robots will protect themselves.  Asimov's rules for Robots [X] seem simple enough, but with the growing number of bots that we interact with daily increases so does the likelihood of making mistakes. How should we update these rules be updated to reflect the growing ethical demands of human-bot interactions?

	Just like humans, bots need to earn our trust... and we can only trust the bots as much as we trust those who are making the bots. 

	As developers, we are constantly looking for ways to scratch our own itch.  This gives developers the unique opportunity to pave the way to adoption, and set the precedence for the future of bot-human interactions. 


	\cl{I cant get the wording right on this bit...  This given the unique opportunity to... ability to test out... it is our responsibility to... us ourselves as guinea pigs for... pave the way for ... set the precedence for the future of bot-human interactions.}



\section{Sidebar}

% [Peggy]
% why bots in SE
Software developers are early adopters and proponents of bots as they recognize their potential to enhance developer and team productivity, as well as significantly improve software quality [1]. 
% why so much adoption in SE; and some not really bots
The adoption of bots in software development has been eased by the fact that developers engage in communication and source code repository hubs, such as Slack, Microsoft Teams, Atlassian's Hipchat and GitHub.  Slack, Team and Hipchat provide a number of integrations with other services, with many of these integrations being referred to as bots (although many of these integrations are more like a scripting language command line interface than a chatbot). 
Furthermore, developers feel very much at ease at using the bot frameworks that are available in these platforms to create bots to address friction points they experience in their own development projects. 
 
We see bots fulfilling a number of specific development tasks. For example, bots provide support to developers by:
%\begin{itemize}
%\item 
automatically committing code after testing (Jenkins CI); 
automatically creating bugs when a test fails (BugBot); 
automatically merging pull requests after a code review (Travis); 
automatically opening issues when a code quality concern is detected (Freud);
automatically testing for user interface changes when a code change is submitted (CompareBot); 
helping teams manage complex complex builds and supporting deployment from within the chat environment (as Hubot does); 
centralizing service and performance monitoring (PagerDuty); 
and interacting with end users (at scale) to answer frequently asked questions and to analyze user feedback (ZenDesk).
%\end{itemize}

Bots are also making their way into the developer's development environment, e.g., Slack Overflow is a new bot that integrates Stack Overflow into Visual Studio.  This bot leverages Microsoft's AI platform to help find the best information from Stack Overflow to meet a developer's needs based on their development context. 
Developers can expect to see more and more bots being introduced into the tools and platforms they use for development related activities.
